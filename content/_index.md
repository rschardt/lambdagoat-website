This is the home of the Lambda Goat and it has been live since mid 2024.

I decided to start this simple site to provide my insight to society and to slowly build my reputation as a source for best practices.

Over the last 10 years I collected knowledge and experience as an IT professional switching between programming (mainly backend) and DevOps.

I am really fascinated by the functional paradigm and metaprogramming.

Therefore no doubt I would prefer NixOS/Nix for managing infrastructure instead of Ansible.

Maybe I have at some point enough time to try out Guix and witness the power of Guile Scheme.

But for now I would invest it into Clojure because it has a certain balance of adpotion, functionality and happiness which is sane enough for funding my life.

There is a convoluted list of topics I want to learn more but also write about.

The list goes:
- DevOps (Selfhosted & Cloud) with NixOS/Nix
- functional & metaprogramming Programming
- Security
- Game Development
- AI & Data Science & Neural Networks
- Freelancing
- Organizing, managing and working remotely
- Work/Life
- Society


I hope you the reader is entertained and gains valuable information.


Have fun
