  <p>This is the home of the Lambda Goat and it has been live since mid 2024.</p>
<p>I decided to start this simple site to provide my insight to society and to slowly build my reputation as a source for best practices.</p>
<p>Over the last 10 years I collected knowledge and experience as an IT professional switching between programming(mainly backend) and DevOps.</p>
<p>I am really fascinated by the functional paradigm and metaprogramming.</p>
<p>Therefore no doubt I would prefer NixOS/Nix for managing infrastructure instead of Ansible.</p>
<p>Maybe I have at some point enough time to try out Guix and witness the power of Guile Scheme.</p>
<p>But for now I would invest it into Clojure because it has a certain balance of adpotion, functionality and happiness which is sane enough for funding my life.</p>
<p>There is a convoluted list of topics I want to learn more but also write about.</p>
<p>The list goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>DevOps(Selfhosted &amp; Cloud) with NixOS/Nix</li>
<li>functional &amp; metaprogramming Programming</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Game Development</li>
<li>AI &amp; Data Science &amp; Neural Networks</li>
<li>Freelancing</li>
<li>Organizing, managing and working remotely</li>
<li>Work/Life</li>
<li>Society</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you the reader is entertained and gains valuable information.</p>
<p>Have fun</p>
<p>The Lambda Goat</p>
